# WordSearch

Shopify Internship Challenge Fall 2019

What I am doing RN: Setting up the words diagonally

**CORE**

1. Create a word search mobile app for Android or iOS (depending on the discipline youâ€™re applying to).
2. The word search should have at least a 10x10 grid.
3. Include at least the following 6 words: **Swift, Kotlin, ObjectiveC, Variable, Java, Mobile**. 
4. Keep track of how many words a user has found.
5. Make sure it compiles successfully.

**NON-CORE**

6. Randomize where the words are placed.
7. Make a slick UI with smooth animations.
8. Make it look good in portrait and landscape.
9. Feel free to add any additional features you can think of.
10. Allow the user to find the words by swiping over the words.

- 6 directions (backwards and vertical, backwards and horizontal, backwards and diagonal, and regular with all the directions)

Implement selecting the words **HARD**
- Create a swiping function
- Once swiping keep track of words it has swiped over.
- If you release, check if the combination of letters is in the selected words array.

**EXTRA** (Create tasks later)
- Splash page
